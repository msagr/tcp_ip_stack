**Part A**

1. Setting up Generic Graph
2. Setting up Network Topology
3. Integrating Command Line Interface
4. Packet Exchange Simulation Infra Setup

**Part B**

Use the network topology to implement :-

1. Layer 2 - ARP, MAC Forwarding
2. Layer 3 - Route Installation, L3 Routing
3. Application - Ping, Traccroute (To test functionality)

**Part C**

Dynamic Construction of Layer 3 Routing Table (How the routers actually populate their table dynamically)

**Possible Extensions -**

1. Implament VLAN functionality.
2. IP Fragmentation
3. Implement protocols like IP-in-IP encapsulation, Tunnels, ..  etc.

4. Demonstrate any networking functionality.

**Goals**

1. Implement Layer2 and Layer3 functionality from Scratch.
2. Implement all logic to parse packet content, take decision what to do with the packet.
3. Implement traffic forwarding pipeline.
4. We shall be building up the topology where nodes would represent Layer3 routers and/or L2 switch or Hub. In other words, we shall be writing simplified code for L2 switching and L3 routing.

5. We shall be using CLI to configure our nodes (routers and switches)
