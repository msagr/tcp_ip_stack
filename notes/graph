**Generic Graph Construction**

1. First, we shall develop a library using which we can create static graph.

2. A static graph, as we know, consists of nodes, edges, cost of edges.

3. This graph can be used to implement for other purposes :
    -> Network Topology 
    -> Routing protocols development
    -> Practice Graph algorithms (Dijkstra etc)

4. As of now, graph nodes are simple nodes, they shall not represent routing devices.

5. In next section, we shall extend our graph to represent Network Topology.

----------------------------------------------------------------

1. A graph is a collection of nodes.


2. Every node will have empty slot into which the interfaces of this link could be inserted. An interface has a :

    a. Name
    b. Owning node
    c. A wire (or link)

3. A link is defined as pair of interfaces.

4. A node has a :
    
    a. Name
    b. Set of emoty interface slots

**Tip** - Try to model Data structure such that it depicts the organization of information in real physical world.
