Glue Concept

1. New way of using Standard Data structures - the Glue way.
2. We shall redefine our DLL (Doubly Linked List) library in a new way altogether.
3. You will realize the benefits of using Glued Libraries over Traditional Library.

4. Linux kernel code uses GLUEd version of standard data structures such as Trees, Linked List etc.

5. Even in industry, it is easier to find glue libraries being used instead of traditional libraries.

6. Lets call our GLUEd Doubly linked list as glthreads - Just a name change, it is still a doubly linked list.

7. The GLUE concept that you will learn with DLL as an example are applicable to any other Data structures.
